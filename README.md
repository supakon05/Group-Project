# Group-Project
Our project is about power and energy consumption, The code let you choose which topic you want to calculate, then you will have to input required values in the terminal and the code will calculate and plot a graph for you and the code will also show you your input and the answer afterwards.The _main_.py is used to execute code that are imported from the other files. These code also need modules to run and to install these modules you need to read the Requirement for the instruction to install these modules.
1. Power and energy consumption calculator (PowerCon.py)
The formula used in this code is E = P*(t/1000). After choosing this topic the code will ask you to enter time(hours) after that you have to input how much power you used in each hour, then it will show you the graph of Energy and Power vs Time. after you close the graph window all the data in graph will be shown in termimnal.
2. AC voltage calculator (Ac_Voltage.py)
The formulas used in this code are V(t) = 220sin(wt+c). w(omega) is calculate by using 2*pi*f formula. After choosing this topic the code will ask you to enter amplitude, frequency and phase shift, then it will show you the graph of Voltage vs Time. after you close the graph window all the data will be shown in terminal.
