# Group-Project
    Our project is about power and energy consumption, The code calculates and plot the graph for you. Once you run the code, It will ask you to enter the amount of hours. After you key in the number of hours, you will have to enter the numbers of kilowatt to each hours you've given. Then when you press enter the graph will display on your screen in x - y axis. The graph tells the difference of energy consumption(kwh) and power consumption(W) to time(hours). The blue line represent energy consumption while the red line represent power consumption.
